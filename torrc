## can be used to contact you if your relay or bridge is misconfigured or
## something else goes wrong. Note that we archive and publish all

## Required: what port to advertise for incoming Tor connections.
ORPort 9001

# what port to advertise for directory connections
DirPort 9030

## Tor opens a socks proxy on port 9050 by default -- even if you don't
## configure one below. Set "SocksPort 0" if you plan to run Tor only
## as a relay, and not make any local application connections yourself.
# Default: Bind to localhost:9050 for local connections.
SocksPort 9050
# Bind to this address:port too.
#SocksPort 192.168.0.1:9100

## The port on which Tor will listen for local connections from Tor
ControlPort 9051

## If you enable the controlport, be sure to enable one of these
## authentication methods, to prevent attackers from accessing it.

## Bridge relays (or "bridges") are Tor relays that aren't listed in the
## main directory. Since there is no complete public list of them, even an
## ISP that filters connections to all the known Tor relays probably
## won't be able to block all the bridges. Also, websites won't treat you
## differently because they won't know you're running Tor. If you can
## be a real relay, please do; but if not, be a bridge!
#BridgeRelay 1

## To become an exit relay change ExitRelay from 0 to 1
ExitRelay 0
